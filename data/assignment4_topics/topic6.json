  "content": [
    "ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles provide additional information to assistive technologies about how elements behave. They help screen readers interpret buttons, menus, alerts, and dynamic components. However, ARIA supplements — not replaces — semantic HTML.",
    "Frontend developers use ARIA roles when building custom UI components like modals, dropdowns, tabs, and accordions that do not behave like standard HTML elements. ARIA attributes such as aria-label, aria-expanded, and role=\"button\" improve accessibility dramatically.",
    "ARIA is important because without proper roles, a screen reader may misinterpret components or ignore them entirely. Semantic structure combined with ARIA ensures that interfaces remain usable to visually impaired users.",
    "Major use cases include complex dashboards, single-page applications, React components, and interactive UI widgets. Advantages include enhanced accessibility, legal compliance, and improved user satisfaction across diverse audiences."
