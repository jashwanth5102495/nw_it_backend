    "Color psychology explains how colors influence user emotions and behavior. Emotional design uses these principles to create positive emotional responses in users — trust, curiosity, calmness, urgency, or excitement. This directly affects engagement and conversion.",
    "Frontend developers use color contrast, palette systems, branding rules, and hierarchy to guide user attention. A well-chosen color palette can highlight key actions like \"Buy Now,\" signal errors, or reinforce brand personality.",
    "Color psychology is important because visual perception happens within milliseconds. Users instantly judge whether a product feels trustworthy or professional. Bad color choices cause bounce rates, eye strain, or confusion.",
    "Major uses include CTA buttons, form validation, onboarding screens, banners, and landing pages. Advantages include improved readability, stronger brand identity, and better user engagement."
