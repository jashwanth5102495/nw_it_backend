  "content": [
    "UX writing shapes clarity and tone through concise, helpful copy in UI elements: buttons, labels, placeholders, tooltips, alerts, and empty states. Microcopy guides users through tasks and sets expectations.",
    "Use plain language, action-oriented verbs, and context-aware messages. Avoid jargon and humor that obscures meaning. Provide helpful error messages with next steps and avoid blaming the user.",
    "It’s important because words are part of the interface. Good microcopy reduces errors, increases conversion, and supports accessibility, especially for non-native speakers or users with cognitive constraints.",
    "Major uses include forms, authentication, onboarding, and help content. Advantages include faster task completion, fewer support requests, and a friendly, trustworthy product voice."
