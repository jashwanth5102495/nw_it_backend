    "Micro-interactions are small, focused moments that provide feedback, guide users, and make interfaces feel alive. Examples include button presses, form validation hints, loading indicators, and subtle animations.",
    "Use meaningful feedback: show progress states, confirm actions, and alert errors with clear copy and motion. Keep transitions short and functional — they should inform, not distract. Respect reduced motion settings and avoid oscillating elements that can trigger discomfort.",
    "Micro-interactions are important because they reduce uncertainty and increase confidence. They make products feel responsive and human. Without them, users question whether actions succeeded or failed.",
    "Major uses include submitting forms, saving settings, navigating tabs, and uploading files. Advantages include better clarity, perceived performance improvements, and delightful experiences that still prioritize accessibility."
