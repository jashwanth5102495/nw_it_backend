    "Typography governs readability and tone through font selection, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing, and paragraph spacing. It sets the voice of your product and influences scanning behavior, comprehension, and perceived quality.",
    "Use type scales to define consistent sizes across headings, body, captions, and UI labels. Choose legible fonts with good x-height, avoid extreme weights for body text, and ensure sufficient contrast. Pair fonts carefully: one for UI, one for editorial content, if needed.",
    "Typography is important because most interfaces are text-heavy. Poor type choices cause fatigue, misunderstanding, and abandonment. Good typography clarifies hierarchy, improves accessibility, and supports brand consistency.",
    "Major uses include forms, tables, documentation, and marketing pages. Advantages include faster reading, fewer mistakes, and a more professional look. Good typographic systems scale cleanly across screen sizes and densities."
