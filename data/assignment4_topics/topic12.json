  "title": "Using Wireframes and Prototypes Effectively",
  "content": [
    "Wireframes outline structure and hierarchy without visual polish. Prototypes simulate interactions to test flows and usability. Together, they de-risk development by validating ideas before costly implementation.",
    "Use low-fidelity wireframes to explore concepts rapidly, then move to interactive prototypes for key journeys (onboarding, checkout). Collect feedback from stakeholders and users, iterate fast, and document decisions to align teams.",
    "This is important because assumptions are expensive. Early testing prevents scope creep and forces clarity about goals and success metrics. Wireframes also help developers anticipate component needs and tech constraints.",
    "Major uses include feature ideation, UX audits, and cross-functional alignment. Advantages include faster consensus, fewer redesigns, and smoother handoff to engineering with clear interaction intent."
